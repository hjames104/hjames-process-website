						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p class="info">I used my research and the perspectives I gained from my interviews to determine two Calls to Action. I also developed a style tile to showcase visual elements that will go into the redesign.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/call-to-action-2-02.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>Based on the information I gained from my interviews, I decided to make my primary call to action “Learn More.” I considered something like “Sign Up” or “Register Now” to push people to sign up for therapy or camps, but after talking with Maria and Angela I realized that the process is a little more complex than that. Most people need more information on equine psychotherapy and the services offered by Mending Strides before they want to commit to a therapy session or camp. The services offered by Mending Strides are far from self explanatory, so the “Learn More” option is essential. </p>
					<p>I also chose to include a “Donate” call to action, because this is a key aspect of the current website. The Executive Director of Mending Strides noted that they are not currently taking a lot of donations through the website but she would like to see that change. By including a donate option at the forefront of the site, traffic to that section of the site would theoretically increase. </p>
					<p>I considered several variations of these calls to action, but the feedback I received from my peers and senior designers during process critique encouraged me to continue forward with these two calls to action. </p>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<p>After determining the Call to Action, I created a style tile to showcase some of the visual elements I intend to use on the redesigned site.</p>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/style-tile-4.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>The elements of my style tile are intended to portray Mending Strides as inviting, trustworthy, peaceful, professional and warm. The colors I chose were taken from Mending Strides' current logo, which is not in use on their website or social medias. I chose these specific colors because I felt they effectively communicated the adjectives I wanted Mending Strides to exemplify. I simplified this logo into one color and placed it in the upper left-hand corner of the home page mockup, which makes up the top portion of the style tile. </p>
					<p>I used the phrase "Healing Starts Here" to communicate the core mission of Mending Strides while also grabbing the attention of site visitors. Additionally, I incorporated the calls to action as buttons that would function to navigate visitors to the corresponding pages of the website.</p>
					<p>I also included several images on the style tile to show a focus on the relationship between horses and people, something that is lacking on the current website. I chose Trajan Pro 3 as the typeface for headlines for consistency, as it is the typeface used by Mending Strides in their current logo. I chose Whitney Book as the typeface for the subheadings and body copy in order to improve the readability of the site and add some simplicity to the user experience.</p>
					<p>Following process critique, I changed the order of the items in the navigation to increase hierarchy. I also changed the donate option in the navigation bar to the lighter blue color to represent a rollover and added a yellow stroke beside the subhead in order to further incorporate that color into my tile. In addition to other small changes, I also decreased the transparency on the list of adjectives to increase readability while still communicating the idea that it is the bottom of a webpage. </p>
