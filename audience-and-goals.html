						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After researching Mending Strides Ranch and interviewing the founder, I determined the key audiences and their corresponding goals.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>In order to make the Mending Strides website as effective as possible, I determined the people groups that are involved with and/or reached by Mending Strides.</p>
					<div>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/audience1.jpg" alt="" /></span>I started by determining client and patient groups that utilize Mending Strides. These include individuals who: are terminally ill, have anger management issues, are working to overcome substance abuse, have served in the military, and have special needs. </p>
					</div>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/audience3.jpg" alt="" /></span>I then created a second audience sector, those who give towards Mending Strides. I divided that into those who give their time (volunteers), those who give their money (donors) and those who give resources or expertise (practical help).</p><p> The volunteer group included people with horseback riding experience, family members of clients and retired counselors. The donor group included church partners and counseling centers. Those who offer practical help included veternarians, healthcare professionals, psychotherapists and horse rescuers.</p>
					<br><br>
					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>In order to effectively reach each key audience group, I developed a sets of goals for the client, audience, and website.</p>
